# User-Auth

Created a secure Node.js user authentication system with [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt "bcrypt website"). Bcrypt is a library which help to ***hash passwords*** and then later checking that a password matches the previous hashed password or not. 


## Functionalities
- Using express for GET and POST requests
- Added salt with hash to make it more secure
- As Bcrypt is an asyn library, so used asyn functions and await
- Used REST Client package to make REST requests inside VS Code

## Installation

Download or clone repository and on the project directory run:
> npm run devStart
